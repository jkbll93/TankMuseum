Looks like we finally get new Client, Tank Museum,  - They requested
first small application to be developed.
Here is what we get from them as functionality description:
- it will be REST webservice
- we will require following end points:
  - a list of all tanks in the museum, service will return ID, name and weight (in tonns) for each tank
    ID type is of your preference, please, suggest the best in your opinion;
    the list should be ordered by tank name
  - end point for adding new tank, it will require name of the tank, and its weight (in tonns),
    and return ID of the added tank; it should disallow adding new tank with the name already existing in the system
  - removing tank, using tank ID
